# Simple Data Science Project: Customer Purchase Prediction

This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end data science workflow, including synthetic data generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training for a binary classification task.

## Project Structure

- `data_generation.py`: Python script to generate synthetic customer data and save it as `synthetic_data.csv`.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `synthetic_data.csv`: The dataset generated by `data_generation.py`. (This file will be created when you run the generation script).
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Objective

The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product based on synthetic features like age, income, education level, and hours worked per week.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure all files are in the same directory.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Generate the synthetic data:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    python data_generation.py
    ```
    This will create a file named `synthetic_data.csv`.

2.  **Run the analysis notebook:**
    You can open and run the `analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab analysis.ipynb
    # or
    jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
    ```
    Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the EDA, train the model, and see the evaluation results.

## Dataset Features

The `synthetic_data.csv` file contains the following columns:

-   `Age`: Age of the customer (integer).
-   `Income`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars (integer).
-   `Education`: Education level (0: High School, 1: Bachelor's, 2: Master's, 3: PhD).
-   `HoursWorked`: Hours worked per week by the customer (integer).
-   `Purchase`: Target variable; whether the customer made a purchase (0: No, 1: Yes).

## Model

A Random Forest Classifier from `scikit-learn` is used for the prediction task.

## Expected Outcome

The notebook will output:
-   Visualizations from EDA.
-   Model accuracy.
-   Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
-   Confusion matrix.
-   Feature importances.
